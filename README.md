# MAC Island Construction Website

- This website was developed entirely by me without the use of any AI tools or Code generators. All code and content (except the designs provided by [Array Studios](https://meetarray.com/)) are my own original work.
- This site is developed using `HTML` `CSS` and `Vanilla JavaScript`. No external libraries or frameworks were used.
- Google Fonts have been downloaded and integrated natively into this project for improved performance and reliability.
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) was used to compress the image files.
- Project is hosted on Netlify for fast, reliable, and secure deployment.
